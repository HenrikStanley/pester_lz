# Pester

## namingStd.ps1

- a duplication of the naming standard repo but in PowerShell form
- not an exact copy of the repo as it doesn't get updated as often
- hoping to move this to the naming standard repo once I can figure out how to Git clone a single file during required uses, and not clone the entire repo



## pester_card_input.json

- used as basis template to post Pester results to Microsoft Teams
- the following line is from where the adment occurs:

```
60:                     {
61:                         "type": "Container"    <-- after here
62:                     }
```
